# phpschedulerlib

status: fail (we are still developing to our first release!)

### .1 what is phpschedulerlib?
php schedulerlib is a library for php, with this library you can use synchronized tasks which get side loaded on the visitors page.
   
### .2 for who is this useable?
we decided to make this library for those who are unable to use cronjobs on their machine, so we use this as a pure php based scheduler.
